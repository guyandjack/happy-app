                        <h3>How much does website creation cost?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The cost of creating a <strong>website</strong> depends on its complexity, the
                            <strong>features</strong>
                            desired and the <strong>design</strong>. A <strong>simple showcase site</strong> starts from
                            <strong>CHF&nbsp;1,500</strong>,(6 pages) while an <strong>e-commerce site</strong> or a
                            <strong>custom web
                                application</strong> represents a more significant investment.
                            A <strong>detailed quote</strong> is always offered after discussing your specific needs.

                        <h3>How many pages does a website need?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The number of pages needed depends on the type of site you want. For a <strong>basic
                                showcase site</strong>,
                            about <strong>5 to 6 pages</strong> are sufficient, including the home page, services,
                            about,
                            contact, and legal notices. If you have specific needs like a blog or testimonials, there
                            can be more. Each project is unique, so the number of pages can vary according to your
                            objectives and the
                            features
                            you want.

                        <p>
                            The timeline depends on the <strong>project complexity</strong>. On average, a
                            <strong>showcase site</strong>
                            takes 4 to
                            6 weeks, an <strong>e-commerce site</strong> between 8 and 12 weeks, and a more complex
                            custom project can
                            require 3 months or more. A <strong>realistic schedule</strong> is always provided at the

                            I design all types of websites: <strong>showcases</strong>, <strong>e-commerce</strong>,

                            Yes, I offer several <strong>maintenance packages</strong> including:

                            Absolutely. All my sites are designed with an <strong>SEO-friendly structure</strong>: clean

                        <p>
                            I don't use CMS (like WordPress), as these tools are often <strong>heavy,
                                energy-consuming</strong> and poorly
                            adapted to the <strong>eco-design</strong> of a showcase site or small size.
                            Instead, I develop <strong>optimized custom sites</strong>, lighter, faster and
                            environmentally friendly.
                            If you need to regularly publish content (articles, news, etc.), I can create a
                            <strong>custom dashboard</strong> that will allow you to easily manage these elements,
                            without
                            having to
                            modify the rest of the site.
