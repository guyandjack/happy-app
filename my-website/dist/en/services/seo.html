                                        <strong>Technical SEO</strong> consists of optimizing your site's
                                        <strong>infrastructure</strong> to
                                        facilitate <strong>crawling</strong> and <strong>indexing</strong> by search
                                        engines.
                                        I work on
                                        technical elements that directly influence your ranking: <strong>loading

                                        <strong>URL structure</strong>, <strong>schema.org markup</strong>, <strong>XML

                                        I identify and fix <strong>common technical errors</strong> such as

                                        <strong>misconfigured redirects</strong>, or <strong>canonicalization

                                        <strong>Quality content</strong> is one of the most important elements of an
                                        effective SEO
                                        strategy. It's not
                                        just about integrating keywords, but about <strong>creating useful, clear and
                                            informative content</strong>
                                        for your visitors. The goal is to answer their questions, showcase your
                                        expertise, and
                                        strengthen
                                        confidence in your business.

                                        I pay particular attention to <strong>lexical field richness</strong> and
                                        <strong>variety of
                                            formulations</strong>, to avoid any <strong>over-optimization</strong> or
                                        excessive
                                        keyword repetition.
                                        This natural approach favors both <strong>user experience</strong> and
                                        <strong>good
                                            positioning

                                        The goal is not
                                        simply to obtain links, but to build a <strong>reliable and consistent

                                        on the web. I
                                        favor a sustainable approach, based on <strong>quality backlinks</strong> from
                                        <strong>relevant and credible</strong> sites in your field.

                            The rate depends on the project scope, competition in your sector and your objectives. A

                            SEO is a <strong>medium and long-term investment</strong>. First effects can

                            takes more
                            time. I propose a <strong>realistic schedule</strong> from the start.

                            social networks, content marketing, emailing or online advertising. My approach is
                            <strong>global and
                                coherent</strong>, to maximize your visibility and attract qualified traffic.

                        <h3>What happens if I change SEO providers?</h3>
                        <p>
                            In case of transition, I conduct a <strong>takeover audit</strong> to evaluate previous work
                            and
                            identify areas for improvement. I ensure the transition happens <strong>smoothly</strong>,
                            without
                            data loss or negative impact. All access and reports belong to you, and I provide
                            <strong>complete documentation</strong>.

                        <h3>Does SEO work for new websites?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Yes, it's even ideal to think about SEO from site creation. For a new domain, I set up a
                            <strong>basic SEO strategy</strong>: clean structure, targeted content, correct markup and
                            technical
                            performance. Even if results take a bit more time, starting with good foundations allows you
                            to
                            <strong>save time in the long run</strong>.

                        <p>
                            I conduct <strong>constant monitoring</strong>: following Google's official announcements,
                            participating in
                            SEO events, reading specialized publications, and exchanging with the community. This allows

                            to <strong>quickly adapt strategies</strong> to search engine evolution.
