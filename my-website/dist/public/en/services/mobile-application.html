                                Android (Kotlin/Java). They offer the <strong>best performance</strong> and an
                                <strong>optimal user experience</strong> by taking full advantage of device features.
                            </p>
                            <p>Ideal for complex applications requiring high performance, access to device sensors
                                (camera, GPS, accelerometer), or a perfectly smooth user experience.</p>

                                multiple platforms with a single codebase. Developed with frameworks like React Native
                                or Flutter, they offer an excellent <strong>balance between cost and
                                    performance</strong>.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Resource optimization</strong> to reduce battery consumption</li>
                            <li><strong>Efficient data management</strong> to limit network transfers</li>
                            <li><strong>Media compression</strong> to reduce the application's size</li>
                            <li><strong>Optimized code</strong> for maximum performance with minimum resources</li>
                            <li><strong>Offline functionality</strong> when possible to reduce data consumption</li>

                        <h3>How much does it cost to develop a mobile application?</h3>
                        <p>The cost of a mobile application varies considerably depending on its complexity, required
                            features, and the type of development chosen (native, hybrid, PWA). A simple application can
                            start from $6,000, while a complex application with a custom backend can represent an
                            investment of $25,000 or more. I always provide you with a <strong>detailed quote</strong>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How long does it take to develop a mobile application?</h3>
                        <p>Development time depends on the project's complexity. Generally, a simple application can be
                            completed in 2 to 3 months, a medium-complexity application in 3 to 6 months, and a complex
                            application can take 6 months or more. I always provide you with a <strong>realistic
                                timeline</strong> at the beginning of the project, with clear milestones to track
                            progress.</p>

                        <h3>Do you develop for iOS and Android?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, I develop applications for both major platforms: iOS (iPhone, iPad) and Android.
                            Depending on your needs and budget, I can propose <strong>native development</strong>
                            specific to each platform for maximum performance, or <strong>hybrid development</strong>
                            (React Native, Flutter) which allows creating an application for both platforms from a
                            single codebase, thus reducing costs and timelines.</p>

                        <h3>Do you offer maintenance services after launch?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, I offer several <strong>maintenance packages</strong> to ensure your application
                            functions properly over time: updates for compatibility with new versions of iOS and
                            Android, bug fixes, performance improvements, and addition of small features. These services
                            are essential to guarantee the longevity and security of your application.</p>

                        <h3>How can I monetize my mobile application?</h3>
                        <p>There are several monetization strategies we can explore together: <strong>initial
                                purchase</strong> (paid at installation), <strong>in-app purchases</strong> (freemium),
                            <strong>subscription</strong> (SaaS model), <strong>advertising</strong>, or
                            <strong>indirect model</strong> where the application supports your main business. I advise
                            you on the strategy best suited to your target audience and business model.</p>

                        <p>I support you throughout the publication process on the App Store (iOS) and Google Play Store
                            (Android). This includes <strong>preparing assets</strong> (icons, screenshots),
                            <strong>writing descriptions</strong>, configuring <strong>product pages</strong>, and
                            managing <strong>validation processes</strong>. I can publish the application under your

                        <h3>Will my application need a backend/server?</h3>
                        <p>It depends on your application's features. Applications that need to store user data,
                            synchronize across multiple devices, or offer features like authentication or payments will
                            generally need a <strong>backend</strong>. I develop complete and secure backend solutions

                            mobile security: <strong>encryption of sensitive data</strong>, <strong>secure
                                authentication</strong>, <strong>protection against common vulnerabilities</strong>,
                            <strong>GDPR compliance</strong>, and <strong>regular security testing</strong>. I also advise you on privacy policies and terms of use.</p>

                        <p>Absolutely! I can integrate a wide range of advanced features in your application, including: <strong>geolocation</strong>, <strong>push notifications</strong>, <strong>in-app payments</strong>, <strong>augmented reality</strong>, <strong>image recognition</strong>, <strong>chat and messaging</strong>, <strong>offline synchronization</strong>, and many others.
