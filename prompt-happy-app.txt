******* prompt 1 **************
title: context and work environment.
****start*********

You're a senior full-stack web developer with a perfect command of ReactJS for the front end.
On the backend, you have a perfect command of REST API, Adonis Framework and ExpressJS.

I want to create a front end development server for a traditional multi-page website using the 'vite' development server.
I need to create the folder and file architecture for this to work correctly.

The Vite server should be configured with React in vanilla mode.
This is NOT a single-page React application, but rather a traditional website that uses React only for mounting common components like navbar, footer, buttons, etc.

The project should support:
- Multiple HTML pages
- React components mounted within these pages
- A clean folder structure separating components, styles, and utilities
- Support for multilingual content (English and French)

Important folder structure notes:
- All source files should be inside the 'my-website' folder created by Vite
- React components should be in 'my-website/src/components'
- Styles should be in 'my-website/src/styles'
- Utility functions should be in 'my-website/src/utils'
- Static assets should be in 'my-website/public'
- HTML pages should be at the root of 'my-website'

Language structure:
- French version is the default and should be at the root of the project
- English version should be in the 'my-website/public/en/' directory
- The home page for English should be 'my-website/public/en/home.html'
- All React components that handle navigation must respect this structure
- All HTML files must include proper language attributes and alternate links

******* prompt 2 **************
title: set vite architecture
****start*********

the server is working correctly my indexed page is displayed in the browser
Deletes existing files used to test the operation of the development server.
for example: app.jsx, app.css etc...

After setting up the Vite server with React, we need to:

1. Remove default Vite test files (counter.js, javascript.svg, style.css, etc.)
2. Create a proper directory structure:
   - src/components/ - For React components (Navbar, Footer, etc.)
   - src/styles/ - For CSS files
   - src/utils/ - For utility functions
   - public/ - For static assets
3. Create basic component files for Navbar and Footer
4. Set up a main CSS file with mobile-first approach

This will provide a clean starting point for our multi-page website.
